In this post, I would be talking about the git workflow that could be adopted when you are working on a project all one and also when you are working in a team. Before we start, lets try to understand what is Git and why it is becoming the leader in Version control/SCM (Software Configuration Management).

### What is Git ?
Git is a version control system with a de-centralized approach to source control. This means you don't really need a centralized server to work with instead you could have your own local version control system and push to a storage area whenever you feel like. Git was developed by Linus Torvalds, the same guy who wrote Linux Operating System. Git was developed out of frustration as Linus found the existing Source Control Systems were pathetic when it came to managing/collaborating across huge team of developers. If you like to know more, listen to [talk][git-talk] by Linus himself on git.

### Want to get your hands dirty on git ?
Before you proceed further, I would recommend you to just try out this 15 minute [git tutorial][git-tutorial] so that whatever I have written below would make sense.

### Workflow when you working as a single man army
The first step would be creating a git repository with the default master branch. **Master** branch should always have the copy of the code which is going to go to production. So during the development stage, it is advisable to create a **develop** branch
