Whenever we learn about some topics or if you are teaching someone, I always felt analogies from day to day life makes a greater impact to a person's understanding. This post is my take on analogy of technologies/terminologies involved in front end development.

I am going to compare building a website to building a house where :

**HTML**(HyperText Markup Language) would be the raw building materials namely bricks, steels, cement. These help you in building the skeleton or structure of your house. Similarly, you build the structure of your page using HTML elements like div, span, p, header, section etc.

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) would be the blue print which defines the layout of your house. It defines the size of your rooms, wall colors, window sizes, position of doors/windows according to your needs. In the context of web development, you use CSS to define your page layout, styling - font to be user, color etc

**JavaScript** would be the electricity/power needed to make your house dynamic and make of things function in your house. Example, if you press a light switch, it should turn on/off the light. You could live in a house without power supply just like you can have a website with javascript disabled or not at all. But lot of things may not function in your house/website. In modern web, JavaScript is a must have just like you need electricity to power up your homes.

**UX** or User Experience would be how good a resident in the house would feel about staying in it. Do you have good ventilation, aeration ? How accessible are things ? Basically, it tells you the comfort level of the house. Similarly in the web development context, this is simply how good the user feels about your site. Its basically what are all the things you would do to make the user to have a great experience in visiting your website - pleasing color, intuitive designs, lesser mouse clicks etc

**UI Designer** would be the architect of a house who would be responsible for the design and layout of your house. In the web development context, he would design the layout of the web page, choose the fonts to be used, the coloring etc according to the end-user/business needs.

**UI Developer** would be the persons actually doing the house construction work. They would start from the foundations laying brick by brick and building the house group up following the architecture plan proposed by the Architect. Similarly, a UI developer would build a webpage following the layout and specifications laid out by the UI designer.

**Front End Frameworks** would comprise of the tools that would aid in the faster construction of a house and at the same time ensure efficient use of materials and resources. You could think of them as readymade units of house like a window frames, prefabricated steel frames so that the construction team need not rebuild these components from scratch. Similary, a framework in the context of front end development aids in reducing the boiler plate code required to get you started and also to help you in following certain guidelines while building a web page/site/app.
