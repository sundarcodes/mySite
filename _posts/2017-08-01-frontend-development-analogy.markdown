You could live in a house without power supply just like you can have a website with javascript disabled or not at all. But lot of things may not function in your house/website.

**UX** or User Experience in your house would be how good a resident in the house would feel about staying in it. Do you have good ventilation, aeration ? How accessible are things ? Basically, it tells you the comfort level of the house.
