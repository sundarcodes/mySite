In this post, we would be learning Angular core concepts by building yet another version of Todo App :). If you are just starting with Angular (version 2+) and want to know what are differences between AngularJS and Angular, please checkout my earlier post [here][angularjsVsAngular].
We would be using [angular cli][angular-cli] for building our App.Just have it installed in your dev box.
Let's get started...

## Here comes the wireframe
This is the place it starts from. Below is the wireframe of how our todo App should look like. It has 2 views - Home where we add our todos and Archive where we can manage our completed todos.
