A software engineer having 12+yrs of experience in writing and developing system softwares for stock exchanges across the globe. Started my career as a C,C++ programmer and has helped companies build network mangement softwares and later went on to build stock exchange management systems software. Moved to web and mobile app development over the last couple of years and has absolutely enjoyed the transition since then. 

Apart from coding, I love teaching and reading. I was a mentor in a programming bootcamp based out of India and enjoyed every bit of it. If you don't find me coding or reading, then you would either find me playing with my daughter or helping out my wife setting up our home. But I have to admit that playing with my daughter is more fun :)
